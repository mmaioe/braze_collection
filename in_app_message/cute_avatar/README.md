# Cute Avatar IAM(In App Message)

## English

In this IAM message, we show some avatar icon along with some simple message.

In this asset, you can try the following Braze's functionalities:

1. [Custom HTML in-app messages](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/traditional/customize/html_in-app_messages/#javascript-bridge) 

2. [Braze Bridge] (https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/message_building_by_channel/in-app_messages/traditional/customize/html_in-app_messages/#javascript-bridge) 

I tried this one only for Web. So, not sure how it works for mobile app.
